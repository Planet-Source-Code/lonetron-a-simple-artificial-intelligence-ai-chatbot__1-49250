[Simple] Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chatbot

This application demonstrates how to write a VB client for an AI chat bot. The code it self is only a few pages, documented and easy to understand. This example uses the What are Transplantable Artificial Neurological Units (TANU) architecture. After you download this VB Chatbot client code point your web browser to http://www.p2bconsortium.com/sss/CreateBot.aspx to create and train your AI chatbot. Then use this open source client to chat with him/her.

You can also modify this code to bind your AI chatbot to both IRC and non-IRC chat systems.

If you need help feel free to stop by our IRC network and ask questions.

Be sure to put TANU in the title of your thread so that TANU trainers can address your questions.
